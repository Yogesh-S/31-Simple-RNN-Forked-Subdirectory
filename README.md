# 31-Simple-RNN-Forked-Subdirectory

In this notebook, we're going to train a simple RNN to do **time-series prediction**. Given some set of input data, it should be able to generate a prediction for the next time step!

- First, we'll create our data
- Then, define an RNN in PyTorch
- Finally, we'll train our network and see how it performs
